# Singpass Student Loans ðŸ¤“

Borrow smart, not hard!

## Problem Statement



## Proposed Solution

Singpass Student Loans is a one-stop platform that streamlines the process of loan application and approval for students, schools, and banks. The platform consolidates the capabilities of loan application and approval from three parties: students, schools, and banks. Its purpose is to make it easy for students to apply for school loans through their school, allowing them to focus on their education.

### User Workflow

1. Register student
2. Login as student
3. Apply for loan
4. Register school
5. Login as school
6. Request loan from bank on behalf of student
7. Login as bank
8. Approve school registration
9. Approve loan request

### Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL RDS
- Deployment: Docker, AWS ECR, ECS, EC2
- Testing: Postman, Unittest

## Next Steps

Due to time constraints, the frontend components were not implemented in this solution. Given more time, I would complete the frontend components using React, connecting them to the backend API endpoints:

### Wireframe Design

You can view the wireframe design of the frontend components by pressing play in Figma: [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/e6XEYZ9C0bzVNIXoLTN8x6/NDI-Wireframes?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=HioERFttNWKGEF7L-1)

## Getting Started

Import the postman collection to call the API endpoints:

[Postman Collection](Postman Collection Link)

- The API endpoints are hosted on AWS by publishing the image on ECR, deploying the containers on ECS, and deploying the application on EC2 instances
- Postman scripts are included to automatically set and get the login tokens as environment variables
